TELECOM CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING  

Predicting customer churn is critical for telecommunication companies to be able to effectively retain customers. It is more costly to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. For this reason, large telecommunications corporations are seeking to develop models to predict which customers are more likely to change and take actions accordingly.

    In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis,
    and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, 
    and  to create a ML model .
